This project outlines the requirements as presented in the coursework for my MS degree.  The primary requirement pertained to all classes must be tested.  The code and cases were intially developed using NetBeans IDE and since ported into Eclipse due to support issues in the former IDE.  This project uses JUnit 4 and performs the unit tests automatically upon build.  I left two "@Ignore" annotations in and, if ported to JUnit 5, could use "@Disabled".
